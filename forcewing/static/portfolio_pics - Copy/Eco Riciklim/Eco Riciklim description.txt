Eco Riciklim

A focus on sustainability 


This hospital waste recycling company founded 2 years ago had a quick growth due to their professional staff and high tech equipment. To accommodate a better web presence, they contacted us to discuss about building a web site where prospective clients could learn more about them and their work. 

After discussing their priorities and the way the company operates, we decided the building blocks of the website and their content. After having the layout in place, we chose colors that matched the company, in order to preserve a unified look. 

The website is responsive across devices. The design was handcrafted using HTML/CSS, based on the web design standards of the year.
